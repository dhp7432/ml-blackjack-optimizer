## 🚀 Next Steps & Future Development

### 🎯 Phase 1: Pattern Detection ML Model (Next Priority)

#### Architecture Design:
```python
# Multi-output neural network
Input Features (50+):
├── Recent card sequence (8-12 cards)
├── Compositional features (counts, penetration)  
├── Pattern features (clumping, momentum)
└── Historical context

↓ LSTM Layer (32 units) → Sequence pattern capture
↓ Dense Layer (64 units) → Pattern integration
↓ Multiple Output Heads:
├── Clumping Predictor
├── Category Bias Detector (HIGH/LOW/NEUTRAL)
├── Shuffle Pattern Classifier  
└── Next Category Probability
```

#### Training Data Sources:
- **JSON recordings** from GUI (`recorded_shoes/*.json`)
- **Card flow sequences** with perfect chronological order
- **Statistical features** calculated from penetration/count data

#### Expected Outputs:
```python
{
    'detected_patterns': {
        'clumping_strength': 0.73,
        'pattern_type': 'FRONT_LOADED_HIGH', 
        'confidence': 0.82
    },
    'next_cards_bias': {
        'high_cards_probability': 0.42,  # vs expected 0.385
        'bias_strength': 'MODERATE'
    },
    'recommendations': {
        'betting_adjustment': -0.15,
        'reasoning': "High cards front-loaded, expect lower quality remaining"
    }
}
```

### 🎯 Phase 2: Enhanced EV Prediction Model

#### Smart Decision Framework:
```python
def enhanced_strategy_engine(hand, dealer, count, pattern, penetration):
    if penetration < 0.30:
        return basic_strategy_plus_count()  # Traditional approach
    else:
        # Full integration: EV + Pattern + Count
        base_ev = ml_ev_predictor(hand, dealer, count)
        pattern_adjustment = pattern_detector(recent_cards, penetration) 
        return combine_recommendations(base_ev, pattern_adjustment)
